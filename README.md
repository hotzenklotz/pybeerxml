Parses all recipes within a BeerXML file and returns `Recipe` objects containing all ingredients,
style information and metadata. OG, FG, ABV and IBU are calculated from the ingredient list. (your
milage may vary)

## Installation

```
pip install pybeerxml
```

## Usage

```
from pybeerxml.parser import Parser

path_to_beerxml_file = "/tmp/SimcoeIPA.beerxml"

parser = Parser()
recipes = parser.parse(path_to_beerxml_file)

for recipe in recipes:

    # some general recipe properties
    print(recipe.name)
    print(recipe.brewer)

    # calculated properties
    print(recipe.og)
    print(recipe.fg)
    print(recipe.ibu)
    print(recipe.abv)

    # iterate over the ingredients
    for hop in recipe.hops:
        print(hop.name)

    for fermentable in recipe.fermentables:
        print(fermentable.name)

    for yeast in recipe.yeasts:
        print(yeast.name)
        
    for misc in recipe.miscs:
        print(misc.name)
```
